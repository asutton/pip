1) What is the problem they try to solve?
2) How are they solving it?
3) What is the difference between their research and ours?  (What they solve vs. what we solve)


The Frenetic project aimed to raise the level of abstraction for programming SDNs. Frenetic provides a suite of declarative abstractions for querying network state, defining forwarding policies, and updating policies in a consistent way. This allows the project to replace the available low-level imperative interfaces. This was attained by designing the constructs in a modular way and implementing them by compiling them down to low-level OpenFlow forwarding rules. \cite{Foster2013}
