\textbf{Languages for Software-Defined Networks} 

The Frenetic project aimed to raise the level of abstraction for 
programming SDNs. Frenetic provides a suite of declarative abstractions 
for querying network state, defining forwarding policies, and updating 
policies in a consistent way. This allows the project to replace the 
available low-level imperative interfaces. This was attained by designing 
the constructs in a modular way and implementing them by compiling
them down to low-level OpenFlow forwarding rules. \cite{Foster2013} \\
