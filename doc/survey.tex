\textbf{Languages for Software-Defined Networks} 

The Frenetic project aimed to raise the level of abstraction for programming SDNs. Frenetic provides a suite of declarative abstractions for querying network state, defining forwarding policies, and updating policies in a consistent way. This allows the project to replace the available low-level imperative interfaces. This was attained by designing the constructs in a modular way and implementing them by compiling them down to low-level OpenFlow forwarding rules. \cite{Foster2013}
