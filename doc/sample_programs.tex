Here we will describe three simple, static, stateless Pip programs: a drop, echo, and static wire program. More complicated (stateful) programs can be created by outputting to the controller port and dynamically adjusting the abstract syntax tree. Doing so removes any proveable properties about a Pip program, and thus will be discussed in a later chapter.

\subsection{Drop}
\begin{verbatim}
(pip
  (table drop exact
    (actions
      (copy
	(bitfield physical_port (int i32 0) (int i32 64))
	(bitfield key (int i32 0) (int i32 64))
	(int i32 64))
      (match)
    ) ; actions
    (rules
      (rule (miss)
        (actions (output (reserved_port all)))
      )
    )
  )
)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Echo}
\begin{verbatim}
(pip
  (table echo exact
    (actions
      (copy
	(bitfield physical_port (int i32 0) (int i32 64))
	(bitfield key (int i32 0) (int i32 64))
	(int i32 64))
      (match)
    ) ; actions
    (rules
      (rule (miss)
        (actions (output (reserved_port in_port)))
      )
    )
  )
)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Wire}
\begin{verbatim}
(pip
  (table wire exact
    (actions
      (copy
	(bitfield physical_port (int i32 0) (int i32 64))
	(bitfield key (int i32 0) (int i32 64))
	(int i32 64))
      (match)
    ) ; actions
    (rules
      (rule (miss)
        (actions (output (reserved_port controller)))
      )
    )
  )
)
\end{verbatim}
